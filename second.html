        <center><h3 style="font-family:Helvetica;Color:Indigo;">Social media has often been compared to a drug due to its addictive nature. It negatively impacts the mental health of its users and often takes over their lives. Many people will often take their phones into the bathroom and be on their phones while supposedly spending time with others. It prevents healthy relationships and causes emotional bonds to deteriorate between both friends and family.</h3>
